# BASIC-VOTING-SYSTEM
This project is a console-based Voting System developed using Python. It allows users to cast votes for any candidate, view the current voting results, and check the winner based on the maximum votes received. It also smartly handles situations where two or more candidates receive the same number of highest votes, resulting in a tie.
